## OBJECTIVE 
1. Built a REST API to convert English sentences to Telugu using LSTM and Keras. 
2. Deploy the built model onto AWS while using Docker-container orchestration.

## TECHNOLOGIES
Project is created with: 
* Python - **pandas, keras, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, pickle**
* Google Cloud Platform - **cloud functions**
* Flask

## ALGORITHMS
* Autoencoder - Decoder 
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
* Attention Mechanism
* GET - POST methodology

## DATA
The data for this project is available as text file on [Data Source](https://www.manythings.org/anki/), where each line has a sentence in kannada and translation of it in english with space delimiter. We manually verified randomly to ensure that each example made sense.

## IMPLEMENTATION

# Modeling
First we build the encoder decoder model, with attention mechanism using GRU RNN. The training was done using Python script available [Here](https://github.com/skotak2/Seq2Seq-Machine-Translation-Model-Kannada-to-English/blob/main/Code/Kannada_to_English_Machine_Translation.ipynb)

# App development
Build a Flask application which can be access from local machine at the address http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict. 

# Deployment

* We will use the [Script](https://github.com/skotak2/Seq2Seq-Machine-Translation-Model-Kannada-to-English/blob/main/Code/Kannada_to_English_Machine_Translation.ipynb) to train the model. After training the model, we will save the model weights in a .pt file and store in google cloud storage. We also build the vocabulary dictionary by indexing each word to a number and pickle them. These pickle files are also stored in storage file. You can access them [here] (https://github.com/skotak2/Seq2Seq-Machine-Translation-Model-Kannada-to-English/blob/main/Storage Files). Once these files are in place, the deployment can be done following the steps below


* We will upload the files on a storage bucket. To Create a bucket using following options as highlighted with following specifications

* Go to products, search for EC2

* Click on "Launch EC2 Instance"

* Choose **Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)**

* Select the **t2.micro** instance in the shows AMIs

* Click on Review and Launch the server.

* Add a new HTTP permission for the VM to be access from external traffic. You would be asked a Key-value pair which is like the password to access the Virtual Machine. Select the option to generate a new Key-value pair and keep it safe as you need it to access the VM from PC.

# Docker
The requirements.txt file is present [here](https://github.com/VipanchiKatthula/English-to-Telugu-Translator/blob/master/requirements.txt) which gives the list of requirements for the docker to be installed in the VM to host our Flask application.

Run the following commands in cmd prompt to connect to the VM:[docker_commands](https://github.com/VipanchiKatthula/English-to-Telugu-Translator/blob/master/docker_commands.txt) where the public-dns-name is in the format ec2窶度窶度窶度窶度.compute-1.amazonaws.com. 

You will be able to access the deployed model in the url: http://public-dns-name/predict
## RESULTS
The deployed model can be accessed from any python development tool like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder. As the data used for the model development was much smaller than the training data for Google translate, we were not able to achieve that level of accuracy. However, the deployed model can be improved upon and made perfect by adding advanced techniques like attention.
